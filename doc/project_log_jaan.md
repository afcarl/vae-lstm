dawen and i ran the variational LSTM specified in the /doc folder on the arxiv dataset

we visualized sample trajectories, but they didn't make a lot of sense (an arxiv doc on black holes followed by a k-means paper - huh?)

next we will run word2vec to get a baseline of what to expect of user trajectories in article space.
